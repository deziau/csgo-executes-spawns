# csgo-executes-spawns

> Spawns for the CS:GO SourceMod plugin ["csgo-executes" by splewis](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-executes)

Since `csgo-executes` doesn't come with default spawns or executes yet because of it's active development, I'm publishing mine for a few maps. Please consider that these configs are not perfect or complete (yet).

The goal is to cover all maps of the active duty map pool, at least with some spawns and executes:
- [ ] Inferno
- [ ] Train
- [x] Mirage
- [ ] Nuke
- [ ] Cobblestone
- [ ] Overpass
- [x] Cache
